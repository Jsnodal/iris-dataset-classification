# Documentation of Iris Classification using Decision Tree Model
# Project Overview
* This project aims to predict the species of flowers in the Iris dataset using a Decision Tree model. The dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, divided into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters.

* The objective is to build a machine learning model that can predict the species of an Iris flower based on its features, using the Decision Tree algorithm.

# Problem Statement
* Given the Iris dataset with the following features:

* sepal_length: Length of the sepal in centimeters.
* sepal_width: Width of the sepal in centimeters.
* petal_length: Length of the petal in centimeters.
* petal_width: Width of the petal in centimeters.
### The task is to classify the Iris flower into one of three species:

* Iris Setosa
* Iris Versicolor
* Iris Virginica

# Data Preprocessing
* Data Loading: The dataset is loaded from the Iris CSV file, or by directly using the load_iris() function from sklearn.datasets.
* Feature and Target Separation: The features (X) are separated from the target variable (y), which represents the species of the flower.
* Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() function from sklearn.model_selection, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing.
* Data Scaling: Feature scaling is performed using StandardScaler to standardize the data, ensuring that all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
* Handling Outliers: Outliers in the data are detected using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method and replaced with the median value to improve model robustness.
* 
# Model Selection
* Model Used: Decision Tree Classifier from sklearn.tree.
* Reason for Selection: The Decision Tree model is chosen for its simplicity, ease of interpretation, and ability to model non-linear relationships between features and the target variable. It does not require feature scaling and can handle both continuous and categorical data.

# Model Evaluation

*The Decision Tree classifier is evaluated using the following metrics:

Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix provides insight into how many predictions were correctly or incorrectly classified for each class.

Diagonal elements represent correct predictions.
Off-diagonal elements represent misclassifications.
Classification Report: The classification report includes the following evaluation metrics for each class:

Precision: Proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
Recall: Proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Accuracy: The overall percentage of correct predictions.
Accuracy: The model’s accuracy on the test set is reported as 100% (1.00), indicating that the model predicts all instances correctly.

The precision, recall, and f1-score for all classes are 1.00, which indicates perfect classification performance on the test set.
Model Performance
Accuracy: The model achieved 100% accuracy on the test set, which suggests that it perfectly classifies all samples.
Possible Overfitting: Although the model performs excellently on the test set, it is important to note that Decision Trees are prone to overfitting. To mitigate overfitting, hyperparameter tuning (such as limiting tree depth) or cross-validation can be employed.
Next Steps
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters (e.g., maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf) for the Decision Tree model.
Cross-Validation: Implement k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance across multiple splits of the dataset, providing a more reliable measure of generalization.
Model Improvement: Try using more complex models like Random Forests or Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for comparison and potentially better performance.

Conclusion
The Decision Tree model achieved perfect accuracy on the Iris dataset, demonstrating the model’s ability to classify the three species of Iris flowers based on the provided features. The confusion matrix and classification report confirmed that the model made no misclassifications on the test set. However, to ensure the model's robustness and avoid overfitting, further steps such as hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation can be undertaken.
